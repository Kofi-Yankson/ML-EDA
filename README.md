## **Cleaning Steps**  

### **1. Checking for Duplicates** 
-The data set was searched for duplicate rows
- No duplicate rows were found, so no changes were made.  

### **2. Checking for Categorical Inconsistencies**  
- Columns that may have inconsistent values due to capitalization (e.g., `'male'` vs. `'Male'`)  and any other kind of inconsitencies were checked individually  see if any of them possesd those errors. The **Gender, Education, and Occupation** columns were reviewed.  
- No inconsistent values were found, so no changes were needed.  

### **3. Handling Missing Values**  
- The dataset was checked for missing values by summing the null values in each column.  
- Missing values were found in  **Primary_App** , **Secondary_Apps** and **Challenges**  
- All missing values were replaced with **"Unknown"** to ensure consistency.  

### **4. Creating Categorical Columns**  
- All **non-numerical columns** were converted to categorical data types.  
- The only **numerical column** present was **Age**.
- the coloumn **Satisfaction** was also changed to a categorical type due to the nature of its use of numbers to categorise rather than provide statistical information

### **5. Checking for Outliers**
- the age column was reviewed using the IQR and box plot to find and display any out liers
