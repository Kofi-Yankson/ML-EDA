#Cleaning Steps
#1.Checking For duplicates
No duplicates were found so no changes where made to target them
#2. Checking for categorization Inconsitencis
 Columns that may have had inconsitent categories due to diffent capitalization such as 'male' and  "Male' where checked individually to  see if any of them possesd those inconsitencies, this consisted of the Gender,Education and Occupation Columns
No inconsistent values were found so no chnages were made to target them
#3.Checking for missing values
The dataset was checked for mmissing values by shoing the sum of null values each column had. the columns that had missing values consiseted of 'Primary_App','Secondary_App' and 'Challenges'
To deal with this each null value was replace with the  value 'Unknown'
#4.Creating categorical columns.
All columns that were not numerical columns were converted to categorical columns, the only numerical column present was 'Age'.
